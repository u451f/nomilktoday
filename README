# nomilktoday

nomilktoday is a collection of phrases to say  *I'm a vegetarian*, *I'm vegan*,
and to ask *Does this food containâ€¦?* in Antillean Creole, Chinese, Dutch,
English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish,
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian.

It also contains a list of food additives that are of animal origin.

I made that website 15 years ago, so it might technically and visually not be
up to any standard.
